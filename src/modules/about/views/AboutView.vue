          Our Mission: Greenwashing the World, One Product at a Time
        </h1>
        <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">
          At Greenwash Goods, we believe that eco-friendliness is more about the
          image than the impact. Our mission is simple: help you look like
          you're saving the planet without actually having to do it. Whether
          it’s reusable items you’ll never reuse, or “natural” products packed
          with synthetic materials, we’re here to make sure your lifestyle
          appears greener than a rainforest—no actual rainforests required.

          What We Do: Sustainability (But Make It Fashion)
        </h1>
        <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">
          We specialize in stylishly deceptive products and services that give
          you the aesthetic of an eco-warrior while keeping things convenient,
          cheap, and disposable. With Greenwash Goods, you can enjoy the perks
          of "going green" without sacrificing the joys of single-use plastics,
          fast fashion, or easy solutions that don't really solve anything.

          Our Approach: More Buzzwords, Less Action
        </h1>
        <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">
          We know that true sustainability takes effort, time, and real change.
          That’s why we skip all that and focus on what really matters—using
          eco-friendly buzzwords and trendy designs to make you look like you
          care. We slap “eco,” “green,” and “natural” on everything, so you can
          proudly flaunt your sustainable lifestyle without having to get your
          hands dirty with all that "activism" stuff.

          Our Values: Style Over Substance
        </h1>
        <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">
          At Greenwash Goods, we value appearances. Why bother with actual
          sustainability when it’s so much easier to market the illusion? We’re
          here to make sure your lifestyle is as Instagrammable as it is
          unsustainable. Our commitment to greenwashing means you can feel good
          about your choices—no matter what they’re really doing to the planet.
